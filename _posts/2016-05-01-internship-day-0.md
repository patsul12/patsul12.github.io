## Day 0

### Tomorrow it begins (finally)

Tomorrow marks the beginning of my internship at DevelopmentNow. I am incredibly excited to see what's in store for me and what I can take away from the exerience.

Development now is a web agency based in portland on the east side of the burnside bridge.
They have developed products for major brands across the U.S in all sorts of different industries and the opportunity to spend the next five weeks there is amazing.

I'll be working with three other talented Epicodus students to build out a full fledged application following agile development methodologies. We will spend the next five weeks going through all the steps of the product development lifecycle and, hopefully, will walk way in the end with experience developing a real world application.

I can't wait to start the step of my transition into software development.
