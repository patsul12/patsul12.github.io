# Internship Week 1 Retrospective

## An introduction to agile

It's been a week now since I started interning at DevelopmentNow and things have been hectic.
We spent most of the week planning out our application and getting set up with the tools used in house.
I really am enjoying my time there and clearly it has been time consuming because
I neglected to keep up with this blog for an entire week.

First things first, the DevelopmentNow office is awesome, old exposed brick and hardwood throughout, 
and we overlook the burnside bridge which affords great people watching opportunity when I need
to rest my eyes from the computer.

<br /> 
The opportunity to work with experienced developers has been a lot of fun so far. In the last week I have learned a ton about planning a software project. 

We spent time writing up project requirements, designing site flows, and the two design students mocked up really good looking wireframes for the project. 

We also had the "opportunity" to be introduced to Jira, which, if anyone from atlassian is ever reading this, is terrible. Just imagine trello, with all the good parts of trello removed, and all the negatives that come with enterprise grade software added, and theres Jira. 

We have decided to go with a React front end for our project backed by a Rails API. So far react ( mostly the redux flow ) is proving to be a challenge to get up and going. I think this is mostly due to the fact that it uses very different paradigms then what we are used to from Epicodus. However, when you finally get things working correctly it run incredibly smoothly and being able to time-travel through your state tree offers a lot of exciting opportunities.

I think we ended the week in a good position and have a solid plan for moving forward with the project ( more details soon ). I'm excited to really get hacking on some of the more complicated features we plan on implementing next week. 

Hopefully next week I can provide daily updated here instead of weekly. We are running into some fun technical problems and I hope that doing wtire ups for the solutions may prove to be helpful to anyone looking to build a front end in react using redux.
